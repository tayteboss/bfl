The communication between the lens, body, filmbacks, and viewfinders is purely electronic. This minimizes mechanical wear and tear, and it improves the design and expansion flexibility. The shutter assembly is metallic and electronically controlled, reaching speeds of up to 1/4000s. The viewfinders are interchangeable, with the primary AE (with center-weighted and spot metering) easily swapped for a waist-level finder. It allow for data imprinting as well as a film barcode reader. The camera utilizes in-lens motors and is compatible with a wide range of Carl Zeiss lenses.",
