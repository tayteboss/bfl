If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our services.</p><h2>1. Definitions & Scope</h2><ul><li><strong>Services</strong> — “Services” refers to all services offered by Bellows: film processing (C-41, E6, ECN-2, B&W), film scanning/digitization (e.g. Noritsu, Frontier, Flextight, etc.), camera & equipment sales, rentals (if applicable), in-store and online purchases, mail-in / drop-off film processing/scanning, and any related offerings.</li><li><strong>Customer / You</strong> — Any individual or entity who purchases or uses Bellows services/products.</li><li><strong>Website</strong> — bellowsfilmlab.com and any subpages.</li></ul><p>These Terms apply to all users and customers of Bellows, whether you use our website, mail-in services, or walk-in at our physical locations.</p><h2>2. Acceptance of Terms & Eligibility</h2><ul><li>By ordering or using Bellows services, you confirm you are legally able to form binding contracts.</li><li>You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> (or older if required for rental or payment). <em>(If you want a different age threshold, set here.)</em></li><li>If acting on behalf of an organization or another person, you confirm you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms.</li></ul><h2>3. Services & Payment</h2><ul><li>Bellows offers film processing (35mm, 120, 220, 110, 127, large format, etc.), scanning/digitization, film and equipment sales, possibly rentals, and mail-in / drop-off services. (<a href=\"https://findmyfilmlab.com/location/bellows-film-lab-miami/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" title=\"Bellows Film Lab Miami\">Find My Film Lab</a>)</li><li>Payment must be made by the methods offered at the time of checkout (online or in-store).</li><li>All prices are displayed in USD. Taxes, shipping, or additional fees (if applicable) will be added at checkout or communicated before service begins.</li></ul><h2>4. Orders, Processing, and Turnaround</h2><ul><li>For film processing / scanning: Bellows typically offers different turnaround times. For example: standard (24 hours), or 72-hour development/scan with a 10% discount if you choose the slower turnaround.</li><li>If you use mail-in or drop-off services: Bellows is not responsible for shipping delays outside their control (carrier delays, customs, if applicable). <em>(If you want to include a “no liability for delays” clause, see Section 7.)</em></li></ul><h2>5. Use of Film & Analog Materials — Limitation of Liability</h2><p>Because film processing and scanning involve analog materials, outcomes can vary depending on film age, storage conditions, handling, exposure, and other factors. Therefore:</p><ul><li>Bellows cannot guarantee perfect results on film — film grain, exposure variation, film age defects, or inherent analog artifacts are outside our control.</li><li>We are not liable for issues stemming from film degradation, improper film storage by the customer, or damage during shipping.</li><li>Once film is dropped off or mailed in and processing begins, you acknowledge that the film is subject to these risks.</li></ul><h2>6. Returns, Refunds & Cancellations</h2><ul><li>Returns and refunds for cameras and equipment: Bellows may allow returns under a separate Return Policy (e.g. within 14 days, with conditions).</li><li>Film, processing, scanning, and consumables (film rolls, chemicals, digital scans, etc.) are <strong>non-refundable</strong> once you submit them for processing or once service begins. </li><li>Orders for film processing/scanning cannot be canceled once work has started.</li></ul><h2>7. Shipping & Mail-in Services</h2><ul><li>If using mail-in or drop-off, you are responsible for shipping costs to deliver film or items to Bellows.</li><li>Bellows is not liable for shipping delays, carrier loss or damage, customs delays (if applicable), or other issues outside our control.</li><li>Once film or items are received and accepted, Bellows will process as requested.</li></ul><h2>8. Warranty & Repairs (If Selling Used / Vintage Cameras)</h2><ul><li>If Bellows sells used or vintage cameras: these are sold “as-is,” without manufacturer warranties, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</li><li>If a camera arrives non-functional (i.e. fails basic inspection), the customer must notify Bellows within <strong>72 hours of delivery</strong> with photos/documentation.</li><li>Bellows may — at its discretion — offer repair assistance, partial refund, or store credit. Issues resulting from misuse, abuse, water damage, or unauthorized repair attempts are not covered.</li></ul><h2>9. Intellectual Property & Digital Content</h2><ul><li>All content on the Website (text, images, logos, branding, etc.) is the property of Bellows or its licensors.</li><li>You may not reproduce, distribute, or use our content for commercial purposes without written consent.</li><li>If we supply digital scans or images to you, usage rights vary depending on the agreement (e.g. personal use, commercial license). </li></ul><p>10. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</p><ul><li>Bellows provides Services “as is.” Except where prohibited by law, Bellows and its employees are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (including lost profits, loss of data, film defects, emotional distress, etc.) arising out of or in connection with use of our services.</li><li>Our total liability for any claim arising from or related to these Terms will not exceed the amounts you paid for the service/product.</li><li>If local law does not allow some of these disclaimers or limitations, they may not apply to you.</li></ul><h2>11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2><ul><li>These Terms and any disputes arising from them shall be governed by the laws of the State of <strong>Florida</strong>, <strong>Georgia</strong>, and <strong>Illinois</strong>  without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.</li></ul><p></p><h2>12.
